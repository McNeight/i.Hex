	<h1>i.Hex Help</h1>
	<div class="content">

		<div style='text-align:center'>
			<div class="bar"><a href="index.html">Index</a><a href="visual.html">Visualiser</a></div>
		</div>

		<div class="heading">Overview</div>
		<a href="http://www.memecode.com/ihex.php">i.Hex</a> is a simple and small hex 
		editor by <a href="http://www.memecode.com">Memecode</a> software. By only loading
		part of the file and using 64bit internal offsets i.Hex can cope with arbitarily 
		large files without slowing down. You can change the values of existing bytes but
		not insert or delete bytes (yet). Also there is a visualisation add-on that lets
		you view data through per-defined C-like structures.
		<p/>

		<div class="heading">Install/Uninstall</div>
		The binary for i.Hex is a self installing setup executable. But once installed to
		a folder the program is completely self contained and can be copied or moved to
		another folder using a file manager. The uninstaller is provided for user's 
		convenience, you could uninstall the program equally well by just deleting the folder
		containing it.
		<p/>

		<div class="heading">Files</div>
		When you open a file in i.Hex only part of the file is loaded into memory at any
		given time. This allows you to view/edit any size file without needing large amounts
		of memory, but it does limit your ability to edit. You can only edit the part of the
		file in memory, after editing some part of the file if you wish to seek to another
		area of the file you will have to save your changes back to disk.
		<p/>
		You can open a file using the File->Open or File->Recent... menu or the "Open" toolbar
		button. If you have a file open then other applications will not be able to read or 
		write to it. If you need to access the file from another program, switch to i.Hex and
		click File->Close.
		<p/>
		If you need to change the size of the currently open file using the File->Change Size 
		menu option. Select the units of the new size, and type in a value. When you click ok
		the file's size will be changed, if the new size is smaller than the old size the data
		will be trucated, but if the new size is large then random data will pad the file out 
		beyond the existing data.

		<div class="heading">Cursor</div>
		The main view is divided up into a hex region on the left and a ascii region on the right.
		Both these panes are viewing the same data, each pair of hex characters represents one
		ascii character. The cursor is visible at all times in both views but only one view has
		the focus. The view with the focus has a darker line for the cursor, and will be where
		and edits from the keyboard will be applied. If the hex side has the focus edits will
		are in hex, i.e. '0'-'9' or 'a'-'f'. Whereas if the ascii side has the focus then edits
		will be whole ascii bytes, e.g. 'a'-'z' or any normal keyboard characters. The <key>tab</key>
		key toggles the focus between the hex and ascii sides.
		<p/>

		<div class="heading">Information Bar</div>
		The information bar to the right of the toolbar is the key to navigating the document.
		Firstly the Offset field shows you where you are in the document as an offset from the
		start of the file. The value of the Offset field is either a decimal value or a hex value
		depending on the state of the Hex checkbox on the information bar. You can seek to a new
		location by typing in a new offset and pressing <key>Enter</key>. If your in hex mode
		you need to type in a new offset in hex, if your in decimal mode the new offset should
		be in decimal. There is also some
		basic arithmetic available in the Offset field. i.e. If you currently at Offset 132 and
		want to move forward by 32 bytes you can type:
		<pre>132 + 32</pre>
		In the Offset field and hit enter and i.Hex will do that calculation and make that the new
		offset.
		<p/>
		The hex checkbox changes the format of the Offset field and the addresses of each line 
		between decimal (off) and hex (on).
		<p/>
		To the right of the checkboxes is a list of feilds showing the data at the cursor in
		various formats. They are grouped with the labels '1', '2' and '4'. This is just the
		number of bytes of data being displayed by the group. The 1 byte group shows the
		byte at the cursor in decimal, hex and as a character respectively. The 2 byte group
		shows the 2 bytes starting at the cursor as decimal and as hex respectively. The 4
		byte groups shows the next 4 bytes starting at the cursor as decimal and hex respectively.
		The display in the 2 and 4 byte groups are effected by the LittleEndian and Signed 
		checkboxes. When the LittleEndian checkbox is on the data is assumed to be LittleEndian
		byte order, typically used by x86 machines (Intel, AMD, PC etc). If switched off big
		endian byte order is used (PPC, Mac etc). The signed checkbox changes whether the data
		is interpreted as signed or unsigned ints.
		
		<div class="heading">Search</div>
		To search the file for something click the "Search" button on the toolbar
		or hit <key>Ctrl</key>+<key>F</key>. You can
		search for ascii or hex data. The search window has an option to search for text or
		hex. Searching for a text string is the same as in a normal text editor or word 
		processor. Options for limited matches to words or by case are available. When specifing
		hex search data you can use any sort of formatting, e.g.:
		<pre>ff aa 00 01 00 01</pre>
		-or-
		<pre>ffaa00010001</pre>
		Work the same. Take into account that searching for a hex value doesn't treat the data
		as integers so if your looking for a intel byte order number then you have to reverse
		the bytes in your search string.
		<p/>
		To search again use <key>F3</key> or File->Next.

		<div class="heading">Tools</div>
		i.Hex includes a tool to <a href="visual.html">visualise</a> the data in user defined formats.
		You can enable this tool using the "Visualise" button on the toolbar.
		<p/>
		You can save the current selection to a file using "Tools -> Save Selection To File". Just the
		selected bytes are written to a file you select.
		<p/>
		If you are viewing a text file and would like to see the data in an easier to read flowed format,
		click the "Text" button on the toolbar and a handy pane containing the text at the cursor will
		appear.
