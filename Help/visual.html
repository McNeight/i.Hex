		The visualiser tool in i.Hex allows you to define new ways of viewing data. Firstly
		once you have a file open click the "Visualise" button on the toolbar to open the visualiser
		pane, which appears to the right of the ascii view. At the top is a list of structure maps
		and a toolbar to add, delete and compile them. These are simply text files stored in the
		same folder as the i.Hex executable that contain user defined data structures. The language
		used to define these structures is based on C but has been extended to take into account
		useful new functionalities available in i.Hex.
		<p/>
		To get started, create a new structure map by clicking the blue "+" icon. The map editor
		window should appear letting you name the structure map and then input the actual map.
		Structure maps are stored in utf-8. The structure defined with the name "Main" is used
		to visualise the data starting from the cursor. Each time you move the cursor the pane below
		the structure map list will update with new contents showing the data as viewed through
		the currently selected structure map. If you want to prevent the visualised view from changing
		when you move the cursor, click the lock icon on the toolbar. When your ready to update
		again, turn the lock off and move the cursor.
		<p/>
		The format of the structure maps are an extension of the C language structures. A simple
		example:
		<pre>struct Main
{
  uint32 Signature;
  uint32 Size;
  char Name[10];
};</pre>
		What this does in practice is format the data at the cursor into a 4 byte integer called 
		"Signature", then another 4 byte integer called "Size" followed by a 10 byte string called
		"Name".
		<p/>
		However you are not limited to the built in types as shown above. You can define your own
		types as well. e.g.
<pre>struct String
{
  uint32 Length;
  char Str[Length];
};

struct Main
{
  uint32 Signature;
  String Name;
};</pre>
		Firstly you can see that I've defined a new type called "String" and then used it in the definition
		of "Main". You should always define structures before you use them otherwise a compile error will
		occur. Speaking of which after editing your structure map, click the compile button the visualiser
		toolbar will compile the structure and tell you if there are errors in the definitions. Secondly
		in the definition of String I have use a variable for the length of a member. This is where we diverge
		from C syntax. What happens here is that the length of the member "Str" is defined by the preceding
		4 bytes interpreted as an integer. This is quite commonly used in the storage of data on disk so it
		makes sense to be able to do this.
		<p/>
		Another import addition to the C syntax is being able to specify conditions on the values of structure
		members. Commonly file formats include invariant values to confirm the presence of the right type of data
		or to tag the following contents with some classification. You can mimic this in the structure definition
		by adding the condition between the variable name and the following colon. e.g.
<pre>struct Main
{
  uint32 Signature = 0xaaff0001;
  String Name;
};</pre>
		The part "= 0xaaff0001" defines a condition on the variable Signature that has to be met before parsing can
		continue. Conditions at the moment can only be integer or string constants. But maybe in the future
		ranges, and other math may be allowed.
		<p/>
		When defining custom types it is common to have a generic type and then a number of specialisations
		of that type. For instance your file may have a list of attributes that all have a common header that
		defined the data type and the attribute's name/id and because you have a common header the reading
		software can skip over attributes it doesn't understand or doesn't need. This sort of behaviour can
		be defined in i.Hex structure maps via a form a sub-classing. An example:
<pre>struct Field
{
  uint32 Id;
  uint32 Size;
  uint8 Data[Size];
};

struct StringField : inherits Field
{
  uint32 Id = 1001;
  uint32 Size;
  char Value[Size];
};

struct IntField : inherits Field
{
  uint32 Id = 1002;
  uint32 Size = 4;
  uint32 Value;
};</pre>
		The "Field" type is the generic type, and "StringField" and "IntField" define special types of "Field".
		These specialisations of "Field" have redefine the contents of the field and add conditions on the member
		variables. What i.Hex does when visualising a "Field" is scans through the types that inherit from "Field"
		and if they meet all their conditions then the subtype is used to format the data, otherwise the parent
		"generic" type is used to format the data. Unlike C++ the inheriting of a class does not automatically 
		include the parents members at the front of the data structure, you have to redefine all the elements, and
		then set the appropriate conditions on members. If you don't set any conditions on the sub-class members
		then if can never be used because there is no way to tell if it matches a given bit of data.
		<p/>
		The full syntax of a member variable is:
		<pre><opt>hidden</opt> <req>type</req> <req>name</req> <opt><lit>:</lit> bitSize</opt> <opt><lit>[</lit>arraySize<lit>]</lit></opt> <opt><lit>=</lit> value</opt> <opt><lit>*</lit> targetType <lit>@</lit> address</opt>;</pre>
		Where each part is defined as:
		<table style='margin: 1em;'>
			<tr><th>hidden<td><opt>Optional</opt> Hides the variable from the output. </li>
			<tr><th>type<td><req>Required</req> Can be one of:
				<ul>
					<li> int, int8, int16, int32, int64
					<li> uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64
					<li> float (4 bytes), double (8 bytes)
					<li> char, char16, char32 (fixed size string)
					<li> strz, strz16, strz32 (null terminated string)
					<li> WORD, DWORD (windows types)
					<li> A custom type
				</ul>
			<tr><th>name<td><req>Required</req> Is any legal <a href='https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/Variables#Naming_Variables'>C variable name</a>.
			<tr><th>:&nbsp;bitSize<td><opt>Optional</opt> This variable is a bitfield of 'bitSize' bits.
			<tr><th>[&nbsp;arraySize&nbsp;]<td><opt>Optional</opt> Is an array index expression in the form '[' + &lt;expression&gt; + ']'.
			<tr><th>=&nbsp;value<td><opt>Optional</opt> Is a constant in the form of a decimal or hex integer or a string.
			<tr><th>*&nbsp;targetType&nbsp;@&nbsp;address<td><opt>Optional</opt> This variable is a pointer.<br>
				<br>
				The actual type pointed to is 'target-type'.
				The address part is optional, if not supplied the pointer is an offset from the cursor, otherwise it's a string expression that can include earlier fields 
				from the same structure, but not later. There are two predefined variables you can use in the expression:
				<ul>
					<li> 'this' - the address of the start of the current structure.
					<li> 'pointer' - the integer value of the pointer itself.
				</ul>
				So if you wanted to index off the start of the current structure you would do this:
				<pre>uint32 MyPointer * MyStructure @ "this + pointer";</pre>
				Or offset from the end of the current structure:
				<pre>uint32 MyPointer * MyStructure @ "(this + 1) + pointer";</pre>
				If you don't use 'this' in the expression the offset is from the currect cursor in the file.
		</table>
		
		The optional parts behind the name can be in any order. The parser uses the initial character to switch to the appropriate handler.
